## Features & Usage Guide

- **User Authentication:** Register and log in to access the board.
- **Kanban Board:** Tasks are organized in Todo, In Progress, and Done columns.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** All changes are synced instantly across all users via Socket.IO.
- **Task Management:** Create, edit, delete, and assign tasks to users.
- **Drag-and-Drop:** Move tasks between columns (if enabled) or use the "Mark as Done" button.
- **Activity Log:** See a real-time feed of all actions (task creation, updates, deletions, assignments).
- **Smart Assign:** Assigns a task to the user with the fewest non-done tasks.
- **Conflict Handling:** If two users edit the same task simultaneously, a conflict resolution modal appears to merge or choose a version.

### Usage
1. **Register/Login:** Create an account or log in.
2. **Create Task:** Click "+ New Task", fill in details, and save.
3. **Edit/Delete:** Use the pencil or trash icons on each task card.
4. **Assign/Smart Assign:** Assign manually or click the ðŸŽ¯ button for Smart Assign.
5. **Mark as Done:** Click the âœ… button to move a task to Done.
6. **Activity Log:** View all recent actions in the sidebar.

## Smart Assign Logic
When you click the ðŸŽ¯ Smart Assign button on a task, the backend:
- Counts the number of tasks (not marked as Done) assigned to each user.
- Assigns the task to the user with the fewest such tasks.
- Updates all clients in real time.

## Conflict Handling Logic
If two users try to update the same task at the same time:
- The backend detects a conflict using the `lastModified` timestamp.
- The client receives a conflict response and shows a modal.
- The user can choose to keep their version, use the server version, or merge both.
